Understanding the selectivity of chiral membranes to chiral molecules. Separation of chiral molecules is a major challenge, since enantiomers have very similar chemical properties.
In particular, there is always a compromise between good selecivity and quick process. 
 
Membranes based on cellulose derivatives are good technologies to separate many chiral molecules.
We use force-field Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to unveil the molecular mechanisms which allows such a good selectivity.
This is part of the CHIRAL CELL ANR, in collaboration with Benoit Coasne.
